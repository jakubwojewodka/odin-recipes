            <li>2 cups of warm water</li>
            <li>2/3 of a cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>3/2 of a tablespoon of dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 of a cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3/2 of a teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>6 cups of bread flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Dissolve sugar in warm water in a large bowl, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix oil and salt into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place in a well-oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down.</li>
            <li>Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well-oiled 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
            <li>Allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
